Difference between declaration,difinition and initialization.

-Declaration
It registers a variable in the corresponding scope.In declaration a variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding scope.
When one declare a variable it is automatic.It is not an executable statement.

-Definition.
Its showing how something has ben implemented like a variable(var),or class of function.

-Initialization

example:

var n; // Declaration and initialization.

var n= "Anitah";

Where my variable registered is (var n) and the name given is Anitah.
